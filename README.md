#DOCUMENTATION:

All code files can be run individually, there is no necessary outlying functions etc. The only requirement is that the fashion mnist csv files must be downloaded in the same folder. The two files are 'fashion-mnist_test.csv' and 'fashion-mnist_train.csv'.

The three main algorithm files are titled:

'LeastSquares.py'
'SupportVectorMachine.py'
'NeuralNetwork.py' 

The other available code files were used to find and graph parameter variance for the respective classifiers.
